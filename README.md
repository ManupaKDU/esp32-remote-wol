# esp32-remote-wol

Remote **Wake-on-LAN** firmware for ESP32 boards.

Wake a PC remotely over the internet even if your home network is behind **CGNAT**
or has **no public IP**.

---

## How it works

1. ESP32 connects to Wi-Fi
2. ESP32 keeps an outbound connection to an MQTT broker
3. Device subscribes to its own topic
4. Valid message → local Wake-on-LAN packet

> Wake-on-LAN must already work inside your LAN.

## Official web interface

https://wol.kreaxv.top/

You can:

- Flash firmware directly from browser (ESP Web Tools)
- Configure Wi-Fi
- Wake your PC using ESP32_MAC + PC_MAC

No configuration required.  
This is the default and recommended usage.

---

## Using your own MQTT broker (optional)

Only needed if you want full control instead of the hosted interface.
